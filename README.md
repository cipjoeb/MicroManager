# MicroManager
## Micro manage all of your time while at work.
This is a small little tool I am working on to help me track how much time I'm spending working on tasks at the office. Got someone questioning how much time you spend in the office? This small tool should help you track your time by day. Need it to do something else? Branch the code, add your features, and create a pull request to share them with the rest of us!
